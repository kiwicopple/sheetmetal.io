Frequently asked questions.

### Is this opensource?

[Yes!](https://github.com/kiwicopple/sheetmetal.io)

### Why use SheetMetal rather than Sheetsu?

In the past I have used [Sheetsu](https://sheetsu.com/) and I am a big fan.
However they significantly increased their prices and have started adding a lot of functionality which I just don't need.
I respect that they are trying to build an enterprise around their product, but for the small amount of functionality I need I can't justify paying \$33/month.
So I developed SheetMetal to provide the same functionality and I pledge to keep the following promises:

1. It will always be opensource so you can self-host.
2. After I have built a robust number of features and the product is stable, I will stop. No additional bloat, just the core functionality that is useful.
3. I will not raise the price above \$5/month to make it widely accessible (unless I find that the hosting/API is costing more).
4. I will not provide personalised customer support, even if you are paying \$5 - I can't justify the time at that price. However if there are any bugs or serious problems then I will definitely fix them.

### I found a serious bug, can you fix it?

Sure, just create an issue on [Github](https://github.com/kiwicopple/sheetmetal.io/issues/). Please make sure to check the open issues first to make sure you're not creating a duplicate.

### How is this different from [other product]?

Probably: a) it's not different. Or: b) they haven't implemented Oauth so they require you to make your Google Sheet public.

### Can you implement [feature]?

If you have suggestions just create an issue on [Github](https://github.com/kiwicopple/sheetmetal.io/issues/). Please make sure to check the open issues first to make sure you're not creating a duplicate.

### Can I help improve SheetMetal?

Of course! Contributions are welcome. Feel free to fork the [repo](https://github.com/kiwicopple/sheetmetal.io) and make a pull request.
