- To _CLEAR_ a row, send a `DELETE` request **with** a `/{column_name}/{value}` path
- To _DESTROY_ a row, send a `DELETE` request **without** a `/{column_name}/{value}` path, but with a payload specifying the criteria

### Returns

On success, returns `204 No Content` HTTP status code, without a body.

-X DELETE
```

Destroy all rows from sheet 'Sheet1' where column 'score' is '42' and column 'name' is 'Peter':
