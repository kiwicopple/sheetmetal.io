## **Clear**

Send DELETE request with a `/{column_name}/{value}` path added at the end of the URL to delete row(s). Clear row(s) where `{column_name}` match `{value}`. Clear doesnâ€™t change the number of rows.

```sh
# Clear all rows where name is Lois
curl "https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0db/020b2c0f/name/Lois" \
-X DELETE


# Clear all rows from sheet "Sheet2"
# where value of column foo is bar
curl "https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0db/020b2c0f/sheets/Sheet2/foo/bar" \
-X DELETE

```

### **Returns**

On success, returns `204 No Content` HTTP status code, without a body.

---

## **Destroy**

Send DELETE request to destroy all matched rows, move up below rows and decrease number of rows. Pass params in a `column_name=value` as params to the request.
