## Clear data without removing the row

Send `DELETE` request with a `/{column_name}/{value}` path added at the end of the URL to delete rows. Clear row(s) where `{column_name}` match `{value}`. Clear doesnâ€™t change the number of rows.

```sh
# Clear all rows from sheet "Sheet1" where name is Jim
curl "https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0db/020b2c0f/sheets/Sheet1/name/Jim" \
-X DELETE
```

---

## Destroy a row

Send `DELETE` request to destroy all matched rows, move up below rows and decrease number of rows.

```sh
# Destroy all rows from sheet 'Sheet2'
# where column 'score' is '42' and column 'name' is 'Peter'
curl "https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0db/020b2c0f/sheets/Sheet2" \
-X DELETE \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "score": "42", "name": "Peter" }'

```

### **Returns**

On success, returns `204 No Content` HTTP status code, without a body.
