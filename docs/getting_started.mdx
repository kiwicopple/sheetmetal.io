SheetMetal is useful if you want to use google sheets as a drop-in replacement for a database, without having to deploy your own server to communicate with it. SheetMetal connects to any Google Sheet via OAuth and provides an easy-to-use Restful API.

### Preparing your sheet

### Migrating from Sheetsu

The SheetMetal API is mostly compatible with Sheetsu, with the following differences:

- SheetMetal always requires a `key`. Your data should be secure. If you don't care about the security of your data it's probably easier to make your sheet public and use Google's sheets-sdk.
- SheetMetal always requires you to specify the name of the sheet
- SheetMetal doesn't supply SDKs, npm modules, wrapppers, etc. You don't need additional dependencies in your projects. The API is simple, just use your favourite HTTP client (eg: [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)).
