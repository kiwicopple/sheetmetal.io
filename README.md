# SheetMetal

SheetMetal connects to any Google Sheet via OAuth and provides an easy-to-use Restful API. This is useful if you want to use google sheets as a drop-in replacement for a database, without having to deploy your own server to communicate with it.

## Motivation

In the past I have used [Sheetsu](https://sheetsu.com/pricing) and I am a big fan. However they significantly increased their prices and have started adding a lot of functionality which I just don't need. I respect that they are trying to build am enterprise around their product, but for the sake of the small amount of functionality I use I just cannot justify paying $33/month. So I have developed SheetMetal to provide the same functionality and I pledge to keep the following promises (as far as I humanly can):

1. It will always be opensource so you can self-host
2. After I have built a robust number of feature I will stop. No additional bloat, just the core functionality that is useful
3. I will not raise the price above $5/month (unless I find that the hosting/API costs are costing more), to make it widely accessible
4. I will not provide customer support, even if you are paying $5. I can't justify the time at that price, and I don't intend toraise the price (see #3)
